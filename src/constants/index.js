    //     "This project explores how the 'Indie' label and pricing strategies influence player ratings of video games. By analyzing a dataset of games, the study focuses on the relationship between being labeled as 'Indie' and the pricing model (free or paid) to determine their effects on player satisfaction. The research aims to provide insights for developers on strategic game positioning and pricing to optimize player ratings.",

      description:
        "This project involves the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to compress and reconstruct images. By analyzing the images of a gymnasium in Buenos Aires (GEBA), the study explores the optimal number of components required to maintain image quality while reducing file size. The project includes 2D and 3D PCA transformations, reconstruction of images using varying components, and evaluation of the effectiveness of PCA in image compression.",
